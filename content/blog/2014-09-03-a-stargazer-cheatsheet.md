I have released a [cheatsheet](http://jakeruss.com/cheatsheets/stargazer.html) for the R package [stargazer](https://sites.google.com/site/marekhlavac/stargazer). Stargazer, created by [Marek Hlavac](https://sites.google.com/site/marekhlavac/), simplifies the process of making well-formatted regression and summary statistics tables. I decided to make this cheatsheet after seeing the version [Zev Ross made for ggplot2](http://zevross.com/blog/2014/08/04/beautiful-plotting-in-r-a-ggplot2-cheatsheet-3/). And I should also mention that there are several other useful cheatsheets created by Garrett Grolemund at [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/). He has cheatsheets for [Data Wrangling, R Markdown, and Shiny](http://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/).

Thank you to Marek for a great package and to Garrett and Zev for their inspiration!

Following Zev's lead, I have setup a quick dataset and I then run through iterations 
of code and the resulting stargazer output.

Enjoy!
